What is this challenge about? It involves to try a different programming language each week, where you'll implement a benchmark and a text interface to measure and automate your tests. If you’d like to participate, please read the READMETODO file for basic instructions and helpful tips. You’re not required to complete everything in a single week; I approach each challenge at my own time, and at the end of each challenge, there is the time it took me to finish it. Remember, the goal here is not just to finish quickly, but to gain knowledge along the way. Enjoy the journey!
